This directory contains experimental Texmacs plugin.  To use it
copy the 'fricas' subdirectory (recursively with its content) to
place where Texmacs searches for plugins, for example '~/.TeXmacs/plugins'
(where '~' means home directory).  If you choose this directory
you should be able to see '~/.TeXmacs/plugins/fricas/progs/init-fricas.scm'
file (otherwise you probably made a mistake during copy).

Note: to work plugin needs recent 'fricas' in the path (recent means
svn after revision 998 or version 1.1.2 or later).  The plugin will
will not work if there is no 'fricas' in the path (then Texmacs will
not show plugin in its menu) or if the 'fricas' found in the path
is too old.
