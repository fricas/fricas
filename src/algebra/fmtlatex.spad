\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  The formatter \spadtype{FormatLaTeX} is part of the \SYSTEM{}
  formatting framework and transforms elements of
  \spadtype{OutputForm} to \
  spadtype{OutputBox} such that they can be
  included into a \LaTeX{} document when the package
  \url{fricasmath.sty} is used.

\section{Overview}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For an overview of the formatting framework in \SYSTEM{} look into the
\url{fmt.spad} document.

\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Unfortunately, there is no document that clearly describes the meaning
of the primitives in \spadtype{OutputForm}. The following code of the
domain \spadtype{FormatLaTeX} is a complete reimplementation, but with
similar intend as the domain \spadtype{TexFormat} (by R. S. Sutor).

The domain \spadtype{OutputForm} as well as the former implementation
of \spadtype{TexFormat} has been analyzed and a new structure of the
code has been designed.

)abbrev domain FMTLATEX FormatLaTeX
++ \spadtype{FormatLaTeX} provides a coercion from
++ \spadtype{OutputForm} to \LaTeX{} format. The particular dialect of
++ \TeX{} used is \LaTeX{}, but for flexibility reasons
++ \spadtype{FormatLaTeX} outputs everything into a fricasmath
++ environment in which certain additional commands are available.
++ These commands are defined in a .sty file that is distributed with
++ the source code of FriCAS.
FormatLaTeX: Exports == Implementation where
  E   ==> OutputForm
  Z   ==> Integer
  S   ==> String
  LE  ==> List E
  BOX ==> OutputBox
  LBOX ==> S -> BOX -- Label box for prologue and epilogue
  HANDLER ==> (Z, LE) -> OutputBox -- (precedence, arguments) +-> resulting box
  H ==> HANDLER

  Exports ==> FormatterCategory with
    environment: (S, S, S, H) -> H
      ++ \spad{environmnt(env, x, sep)} returns a handler that typesets
      ++ its arguments (without parentheses) in a \LaTeX{} environment
      ++ with name \spad{env}. The string \spad{x} is put right after
      ++ the start of the environment.
      ++ The arguments are separated by the string \spad{sep}.

  Implementation ==> add
    Rep ==> Record(prolog: BOX, fmt: BOX, epilog: BOX)
    import from Rep
    rep x ==> (x@%) pretend Rep
    per x ==> (x@Rep) pretend %

    FE ==> formatExpression
    MIN ==> minPrecedence()
    MAX ==> maxPrecedence()

    coerce(x: %): OutputForm == rep(x)::OutputForm

\spad{texEscapeString(s)} escapes all \TeX{} special characters.
These characters are: \verb|\ { } $ ^ _ % ~ # &|.
We prepend these characters with a backslash in front of them.
Of course, this requires at least for \verb'\\' and \verb'\^' to define
them appropriately in the style file

In order to keep spaces, we also escape spaces by a backslash.

The handler \spad{altsupersub} treats an expression that is generated by
\begin{verbcode}
supersub(a, [sub1, super1, sub2, super2, ...])
\end{verbcode}
from \spadtype{OutputForm}.
We basically turn it into something like
\begin{verbcode}
\ALTSUPERSUB{a}{_{sub1}^{super1}_{sub2}^{super2}...}
\end{verbcode}
and let an appropriate \LaTeX{} package deal with the actual formatting,
for example, the \href{http://www.ctan.org/pkg/tensor}{tensor package}.

For example, for
\begin{verbcode}
supersub(x, [a, b, 1, 2+b, 1/3, 4])
\end{verbcode}
the above code then looks like this
\begin{verbcode}
\ALTSUPERSUB{\SYMBOL{x}}{_{\SYMBOL{a}}^{\SYMBOL{b}}_{1}^{2+\SYMBOL{b}}_{\frac{1}{3}}^{4}}
\end{verbcode}
and is printed like this.
\begin{fricasmath}{}

\section{Customization}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The visual appearance of expressions in a \LaTeX{} document can be
customized in two places. The definitions of the \TeX{} commands in
the style file \url{fricasmath.sty} can be changed. Furthermore also
the internal data structure of the handlers can be modified, see
documentation of the formatting framework in \SYSTEM{}.
