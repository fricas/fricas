++ Description: PlottablePlaneCurveCategory is the category of curves in the
++ plane which may be plotted via the graphics facilities.  Functions are
++ provided for obtaining lists of lists of points, representing the
++ branches of the curve, and for determining the ranges of the
++ x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the points on the curve.
