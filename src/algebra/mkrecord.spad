)abbrev package MKRECORD MakeRecord
++ Description:
++  MakeRecord is used internally by the interpreter to create record
++  types which are used for doing parallel iterations on streams.
MakeRecord(S : Type, T : Type) : public == private where
  public == with
    makeRecord : (S, T) -> Record(part1 : S, part2 : T)
      ++ makeRecord(a, b) creates a record object with type
      ++ Record(part1 : S, part2 : T), where part1 is \spad{a} and
      ++ part2 is \spad{b}.
  private == add
    makeRecord(s : S, t : T)  ==
      [s, t]$Record(part1 : S, part2 : T)
