++ Computation of fixed points of mappings on streams
++ Author: Burge, Watt (revised by Williamson)
++ Date Created: 1986
++ Keywords: stream, fixed point
++ Examples:

ParadoxicalCombinatorsForStreams(A) : Exports == Implementation where
  ++ This package implements fixed-point computations on streams.
  A  :   Type
  ST ==> Stream
  L  ==> List
  I  ==> Integer

  Exports ==> with
    Y : (ST A -> ST A) -> ST A
      ++ Y(f) computes a fixed point of the function f.
    Y : (L ST A -> L ST A, I) -> L ST A
      ++ Y(g, n) computes a fixed point of the function g, where g takes
      ++ a list of n streams and returns a list of n streams.

  Implementation ==> add
    UninitializedStream : S := _$UninitializedStream$Lisp pretend S

    Y f ==
      y : ST A := CONS(UninitializedStream, 0$I)$Lisp
      j := f y
      RPLACA(y, frst j)$Lisp
      RPLACD(y, rst j)$Lisp
      y

    Y(g, n) ==
      x : L ST A := [CONS(UninitializedStream, 0$I)$Lisp for i in 1..n]
      j := g x
      for xi in x for ji in j repeat
        RPLACA(xi, frst ji)$Lisp
        RPLACD(xi, rst ji)$Lisp
      x
