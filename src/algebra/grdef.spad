  maxWidth  ==> 1000
  maxHeight ==> 1000

  Exports ==> with
    clipPointsDefault : () -> B
      ++ clipPointsDefault() determines whether or not automatic clipping is
      ++ to be done.
    drawToScale : () -> B
      ++ drawToScale() determines whether or not plots are to be drawn to scale.

    clipPointsDefault : B -> B
      ++ clipPointsDefault(true) turns on automatic clipping;
      ++ \spad{clipPointsDefault(false)} turns off automatic clipping.
      ++ The default setting is true.
    drawToScale : B -> B
      ++ drawToScale(true) causes plots to be drawn to scale.
      ++ \spad{drawToScale(false)} causes plots to be drawn so that they
      ++ fill up the viewport window.
      ++ The default setting is false.

--% settings from the two-dimensional plot package

    adaptive : () -> B
      ++ adaptive() determines whether plotting will be done adaptively.
    maxPoints : () -> I
      ++ maxPoints() returns the maximum number of points in a plot.
    minPoints : () -> I
      ++ minPoints() returns the minimum number of points in a plot.
    screenResolution : () -> I
      ++ screenResolution() returns the screen resolution n.

    adaptive : B -> B
      ++ adaptive(true) turns adaptive plotting on;
      ++ \spad{adaptive(false)} turns adaptive plotting off.
    maxPoints : I -> I
      ++ maxPoints() sets the maximum number of points in a plot.
    minPoints : I -> I
      ++ minPoints() sets the minimum number of points in a plot.
    screenResolution : I -> I
      ++ screenResolution(n) sets the screen resolution to n.
