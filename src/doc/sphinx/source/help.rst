If you run into any problems with |FriCAS| do not hesitate to send
your problem to |PACKAGE_BUGREPORT|, i.e., the |mailing list|. Since
we do not want spam, you have to subscribe to the |mailing list| in
order to post something there.

There is also a
`read-only mirror
<https://www.mail-archive.com/fricas-devel@googlegroups.com/>`_
of the mailing list.


We are well aware of the steep learning curve of |FriCAS|. By asking
your questions, you not only give you a chance to solve your problem
quickly, but also help us to improve |FriCAS| by letting us know of
what a user finds hard to accomplish with the system.

Apart from the |home page| (in particular the |PACKAGE_BOOK|) there
is also help available locally. You can generate a local copy of the
|home page|, see
`Building documentation <install.html#building-documentation>`_
for instructions.


If you are working with |FriCAS| in an operating system that has
the `X Window System <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System>`_
available, you can find most of the information
in HyperDoc (see the |PACKAGE_BOOK| for more information about
HyperDoc), which is started when you start |FriCAS|.

In a |FriCAS| session there are special commands starting with a
closing parenthesis in the first column. You can get more information
about them by typing

::

  )help help

  )help set

In particular, for the `)set` command you can find the output
`here <fricas-notebooks/system-command-set.html>`_.
