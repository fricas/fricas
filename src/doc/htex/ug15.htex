%------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{FriCAS 1.0.0}
%------------------------------------------------------------------

The 1.0 release is the first release of FriCAS. Below we list main
differences compared to AXIOM September 2006.

Numerous bug fixes (in particular HyperDoc in now fully functional on
Unix systems).

FriCAS includes guessing package written by Martin Rubey. This package
provides unique ability to guess formulas for sequences of numbers or
polynomials.

Some computation, in particular involving Expression domain, should be
much faster. FriCAS to go trough its testsuite needs only half of the
time needed by AXIOM September 2006.

Spad compilation is faster (in some cases 2 times faster).

FriCAS is much more portable than AXIOM September 2006. It can be
build on Linux, many Unix systems (for example Mac OSX and Solaris 10)
and Windows. It can be build on top of gcl, sbcl, clisp or openmcl
(gcl and sbcl based FriCAS is fully functional, clisp or openmcl based
one lacks graphic support).

Many unused or non-working parts are removed from FriCAS. In
particular FriCAS does not contain support for NAG numerical library.

FriCAS can be build from sources using only a few pre-generated Lisp
files for bootstrap -- only to bootstrap Shoe translator. This means
that modifying FriCAS algebra is now much easier.

  supported, so instead of \spad{.01} use \spad{0.01}

\item Anonymous functions using \spad{\#1}, \spad{\#2}, etc. are no
  longer supported, to define anonymous functions use \spad{+->}.

\item Braces no longer construct sets. So instead of
  \spad{\{'sin, 'cos\}::Set(Symbol)} use
  \spad{set(['sin, 'cos])$Set(Symbol)}.

\item Old Spad used colon (\spad{:}) to denote convertion, like
  \spad{pretend} but performing even less checking. This is no longer
  supported, use \spad{::} or \spad{pretend} instead.

\item There was an alternative spelling for brackets and braces, in
  FriCAS this is no longer supported, so one has to write brackets and
  braces as is.

\item \spad{SubsetCategory} was handled in special way by the
  compiler. This is no longer supported.

\item Old Spad compiler used to transform relational operators
  \spad{~=,<=,>,>=} in ways which are correct for linear order, but
  may conflict with other uses (as partial order or when generating
  \spad{OutputForm}). FriCAS no longer performs this transformation.
  Similarely, Spad parser no longer treats \spad{\^} and \spad{\^=} in
  special way.

\item Quote in old Spad allowed to insert arbitray literal Lisp data,
  FriCAS only allows symbols after quote. Code using old behaviour
  needs to be rewritten, however it seems that this feature was almost
  unused, so this should be no problem.

\item Old Spad treated statement consisting just of constructor name
  (with arguments if needed) as request to import the constructor.
  FriCAS requires \spad{import} keyword.

\item In FriCAS \spad{**, \^, ->} are right associative. Also, right
  binding power of \spad{+->} is increased, which allows more natural
  writing of code.

\item Few non-working experimental features are removed, in particular
  partial support for APL-like syntax.

\item FriCAS implemented parametric macros in the Spad compiler.

\item FriCAS allows simplified form for exporting constants (without
  \spad{constant} keyword).

\item FriCAS added partial support for exception handling (currently
  only \spad{finally} part).

\item The \spad{leave} construct is removed from FriCAS. Use
  \spad{break} instead.

\item \spad{div} is no longer a keyword. \spad{free}, \spad{generate},
  \spad{goto} are FriCAS keywords.

\item '\$Lisp' calls now must have a type

\item \spad{error} did only minimal checking of its argument.  Now
  argument to \spad{error} must be a \spad{String} or \spad{OutputForm}
  or a literal list of \spad{OutputForm}-s.

\end{enumerate}

There are also library changes that affect user code:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \spad{**} lost its definition as exponentiation, use \spad{\^}
  instead.

\item \spad{\^} is no longer used as negation (it means exponentiation
  now) and \spad{\^=} no longer means inequality, use \spad{not} and
  \spad{\~=} instead.

\item \spad{setelt} is renamed to \spad{setelt!}.

\item Operator properties are now symbols and not strings, so instead
  of \spad{has?(op, "even")} use \spad{has?(op, 'even)}

\item There is new category \spad{Comparable}, several constructors
  that asserted \spad{OrderedSet} now only assert \spad{Comparable}.
\end{enumerate}

\head{section}{Old News about AXIOM Version 2.x}{ugWhatsNewNAG}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many things have changed in this version of AXIOM and
we describe many of the more important topics here.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------
%\head{section}{The New \Language{} Library Compiler}{ugWhatsNewAsharp}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% A new compiler is now available for \Language{}.
% The programming language is referred to as the \Language{} Extension Language
% (or \axiomxl{} for short), and
% improves upon the old \Language{} language in many ways.
% The \spadcmd{)compile} command has been upgraded to be able to
% invoke the new or old compilers.
% The language and the compiler are described in the hard-copy
% documentation which came with your \Language{} system.
%
% To ease the chore of upgrading your {\it .spad} files (old
% compiler) to {\it .as} files (new compiler), the
% \spadcmd{)compile} command has been given a {\tt )translate}
% option. This invokes a special version of the old compiler which
% parses and analyzes your old code and produces augmented code
% using the new syntax.
% Please be aware that the translation is not necessarily one
% hundred percent complete or correct.
% You should attempt to compile the output with the \axiomxl{} compiler
% and make any necessary corrections.

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Content removed, NAGLink is no longer included in FriCAS.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\head{subsection}{Interactive Front-end and Language}{ugWhatsNewLanguage}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------

The \spad{leave} keyword has been replaced by the
\spad{break} keyword for compatibility with the new AXIOM
extension language.
See section \spadref{ugLangLoopsBreak}
for more information.

Curly braces are no longer used to create sets. Instead, use
\spadfun{set} followed by a bracketed expression. For example,
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{set [1,2,3,4]}
}

Curly braces are now used to enclose a block (see section
\spadref{ugLangBlocks}
for more information). For compatibility, a block can still be
enclosed by parentheses as well.

% ``Free functions'' created by the \axiomxl{} compiler can now be
% loaded and used within the AXIOM interpreter. A {\it free
% function} is a library function that is implemented outside a
% domain or category constructor.

New coercions to and from type \spadtype{Expression} have been
added. For example, it is now possible to map a polynomial
represented as an expression to an appropriate polynomial type.

Various messages have been added or rewritten for clarity.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\head{subsection}{Library}{ugWhatsNewLibrary}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------

The \spadtype{FullPartialFractionExpansion}
domain has been added. This domain computes factor-free full
partial fraction expansions.
See section
\xmpref{FullPartialFractionExpansion}
for examples.

We have implemented the Bertrand/Cantor algorithm for integrals of
hyperelliptic functions. This brings a major speedup for some
classes of algebraic integrals.

We have implemented a new (direct) algorithm for integrating trigonometric
functions. This brings a speedup and an improvement in the answer
quality.

The {\sf SmallFloat} domain has been renamed
\spadtype{DoubleFloat} and {\sf SmallInteger} has been renamed
\spadtype{SingleInteger}. The new abbreviations as
\spadtype{DFLOAT} and \spadtype{SINT}, respectively.
We have defined the macro {\sf SF}, the old abbreviation for {\sf
SmallFloat}, to expand to \spadtype{DoubleFloat} and modified
the documentation and input file examples to use the new names
and abbreviations. You should do the same in any private \Language{}
files you have.

We have made improvements to the differential equation solvers
and there is a new facility for solving systems of first-order
linear differential equations.
In particular, an important fix was made to the solver for
inhomogeneous linear ordinary differential equations that
corrected the calculation of particular solutions.
We also made improvements to the polynomial
and transcendental equation solvers including the
ability to solve some classes of systems of transcendental
equations.

The efficiency of power series have been improved and left and right
expansions of \spad{tan(f(x))} at \spad{x =} a pole of \spad{f(x)}
can now be computed.
A number of power series bugs were fixed and the \spadtype{GeneralUnivariatePowerSeries}
domain was added.
The power series variable can appear in the coefficients and when this
happens, you cannot differentiate or integrate the series.  Differentiation
and integration with respect to other variables is supported.

A domain was added for representing asymptotic expansions of a
function at an exponential singularity.

For limits, the main new feature is the exponential expansion domain used
to treat certain exponential singularities.  Previously, such singularities
were treated in an {\it ad hoc} way and only a few cases were covered.  Now
AXIOM can do things like

\begin{verbatim}
limit( (x+1)^(x+1)/x^x - x^x/(x-1)^(x-1), x = %plusInfinity)
\end{verbatim}

in a systematic way.  It only does one level of nesting, though.  In other
words, we can handle \spad{exp(} some function with a pole \spad{)}, but not
\texht{\linebreak}{} \spad{exp(exp(} some function with a pole \spad{)).}

The computation of integral bases has been improved through careful
use of Hermite row reduction. A P-adic algorithm
for function fields of algebraic curves in finite characteristic has also
been developed.

Miscellaneous:
There is improved conversion of definite and indefinite integrals to
\spadtype{InputForm};
binomial coefficients are displayed in a new way;
some new simplifications of radicals have been implemented;
the operation \spadfun{complexForm} for converting to rectangular coordinates
has been added;
symmetric product operations have been added to \spadtype{LinearOrdinaryDifferentialOperator}.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\head{subsection}{\HyperName}{ugWhatsNewHyperDoc}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------

The buttons on the titlebar and scrollbar have been replaced
with ones which have a 3D effect. You can change the foreground and
background colors of these ``controls'' by including and modifying
the following lines in your {\bf .Xdefaults} file.
\begin{verbatim}
Axiom.hyperdoc.ControlBackground: White
Axiom.hyperdoc.ControlForeground: Black
\end{verbatim}

For various reasons, \HyperName{} sometimes displays a
secondary window. You can control the size and placement of this
window by including and modifying
the following line in your {\bf .Xdefaults} file.
%
\begin{verbatim}
Axiom.hyperdoc.FormGeometry: =950x450+100+0
\end{verbatim}
%
This setting is a standard X Window System geometry specification:
you are requesting a window 950 pixels wide by 450 deep and placed in
the upper left corner.

Some key definitions have been changed to conform more closely
with the CUA guidelines. Press
\texht{F9}{\downlink{F9}{ugHyperKeysPage}}
to see the current definitions.

Input boxes (for example, in the Browser) now accept paste-ins from
the X Window System. Use the second button to paste in something
you have previously copied or cut. An example of how you can use this
is that you can paste the type from an \Language{} computation
into the main Browser input box.

\head{subsection}{Documentation}{ugWhatsNewDocumentation}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\texht{
We describe here a few additions to the on-line
version of the AXIOM book which you can read with
HyperDoc.
}{}

A section has been added to the graphics chapter, describing
how to build \twodim{} graphs from lists of points. An example is
given showing how to read the points from a file.
See section \spadref{ugGraphTwoDbuild}
for details.

A further section has been added to that same chapter, describing
how to add a \twodim{} graph to a viewport which already
contains other graphs.
See section
\spadref{ugGraphTwoDappend}
for details.

Chapter 3
and the on-line \HyperName{} help have been unified.

An explanation of operation names ending in ``?'' and ``!'' has
been added to the first chapter.
See the
end of the section
\spadref{ugIntroCallFun}
for details.

An expanded explanation of using predicates has
been added to the sixth chapter. See the
example involving \userfun{evenRule} in the middle of the section
\spadref{ugUserRules}
for details.

Documentation for the \spadcmd{)compile}, \spadcmd{)library} and
\spadcmd{)load} commands has been greatly changed. This reflects
the ability of the \spadcmd{)compile} to now invoke the \axiomxl{}
compiler, the impending deletion of the \spadcmd{)load} command
and the new \spadcmd{)library} command.
The \spadcmd{)library} command replaces \spadcmd{)load} and is
compatible with the compiled output from both the old and new
compilers.

\head{subsection}{New polynomial domains and algorithms}{ugTwoTwoPolynomials}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------
Univariate polynomial factorisation over the integers has been
enhanced by updates to the \spadtype{GaloisGroupFactorizer} type
and friends from Frederic Lehobey (Frederic.Lehobey@lifl.fr, University of
Lille I, France).

The package constructor \spadtype{PseudoRemainderSequence}
provides efficient algorithms by Lionel Ducos
(Lionel.Ducos@mathlabo.univ-poitiers.fr, University of Poitiers, France)
for computing sub-resultants.
This leads to a speed up in many places in \Language{} where
sub-resultants are computed (polynomial system solving,
algebraic factorization, integration).

Based on this package, the domain constructor
\spadtype{NewSparseUnivariatePolynomial}
extends the constructor \spadtype{SparseUnivariatePolynomial}.
In a similar way, the \spadtype{NewSparseMultivariatePolynomial} extends
the constructor \spadtype{SparseUnivariatePolynomial};
it also provides some additional operations related
to polynomial system solving by means of triangular sets.

Several domain constructors implement
regular triangular sets (or regular chains).
Among them \spadtype{RegularTriangularSet}
and \spadtype{SquareFreeRegularTriangularSet}.
They also implement an algorithm by Marc Moreno Maza (marc@nag.co.uk, NAG)
for computing triangular decompositions of polynomial systems.
This method is refined in the package \spadtype{LazardSetSolvingPackage}
in order to produce decompositions by means of Lazard triangular sets.
For the case of polynomial systems with finitely many solutions,
these decompositions can also be computed by
the package \spadtype{LexTriangularPackage}.

The domain constructor \spadtype{RealClosure} by Renaud Rioboo
(Renaud.Rioboo@lip6.fr, University of Paris 6, France)
provides the real closure of an ordered field.
The implementation is based on interval arithmetic.
Moreover, the design of this constructor and its related
packages allows an easy use of other codings for real algebraic numbers.

Based on triangular decompositions and the \spadtype{RealClosure} constructor,
the package \spadtype{ZeroDimensionalSolvePackage}
provides operations for computing symbolically the real or complex roots
of polynomial systems with finitely many solutions.

Polynomial arithmetic with non-commutative variables
has been improved too by a contribution of Michel Petitot
(Michel.Petitot@lifl.fr, University of Lille I, France).
The domain constructors \spadtype{XRecursivePolynomial}
and \spadtype{XDistributedPolynomial} provide
recursive and distributed representations for these polynomials.
They are the non-commutative equivalents for
the \spadtype{SparseMultivariatePolynomial}
and \spadtype{DistributedMultivariatePolynomial} constructors.
The constructor \spadtype{LiePolynomial} implement Lie
polynomials in the Lyndon basis.
The constructor \spadtype{XPBWPolynomial} manage polynomials
with non-commutative variables in
the \texht{Poincar\'e}{Poincare\space{-1}'}-Birkhoff-Witt basis from the Lyndon basis.
This allows to compute in the Lie Group associated with a
free nilpotent Lie algebra by using the \spadtype{LieExponentials}
domain constructor.
