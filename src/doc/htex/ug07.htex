This chapter shows how to use the \Language{} graphics facilities
\index{graphics}
under the X Window System.
\Language{} has \twodim{} and \threedim{} drawing and rendering
packages that allow the drawing, coloring, transforming, mapping,
clipping, and combining of graphic output from \Language{}
computations.
This facility is particularly useful for investigating problems in
areas such as topology.
The graphics package is capable of plotting functions of one or
more variables or plotting parametric surfaces and curves.
Various coordinate systems are also available, such as polar and
spherical.

A graph is displayed in a viewport window and it has a
\index{viewport}
control-panel that uses interactive mouse commands.
PostScript and other output forms are available so that \Language{}
\index{PostScript}
images can be printed or used by other programs.\footnote{PostScript

States.}

The \Language{} \twodim{} graphics package provides the ability to
\index{graphics!two-dimensional}
display
%
\begin{itemize}
%
\item curves defined by functions of a single real variable
%
\item curves defined by parametric equations
%
\item implicit non-singular curves defined by polynomial equations
%
\item planar graphs generated from lists of point components.
\end{itemize}
These graphs
can be modified by specifying various options, such as
calculating points in the polar
coordinate system or changing the size of the graph viewport window.

\head{subsection}{Plotting Two-Dimensional Functions of One Variable}{ugGraphTwoDPlot}
% *********************************************************************

\index{curve!one variable function}
The first kind of \twodim{} graph is that of a curve defined by a function
\spad{y = f(x)} over a finite interval of the \spad{x} axis.

%
\beginImportant
The general format for drawing a function defined by a formula
\spad{f(x)} is:
%
\begin{center}
{\tt draw(f(x), x = a..b, {\it options})}
\end{center}
where \spad{a..b} defines the range of \spad{x}, and where
{\it options} prescribes zero or more options as described in
\spadref{ugGraphTwoDOptions}.
An example of an option is \spad{curveColor == bright red().}
An alternative format involving functions \spad{f} and \spad{g}
is also available.
\endImportant

A simple way to plot a function is to use a formula.
The first argument is the formula.
For the second argument, write the name of the independent variable (here, \spad{x}),
followed by an \spadSyntax{=}, and the range of values.

\psXtc{
Display this formula over the range
\texht{$0 \leq x \leq 6$}{0 <= x <= 6}.
\Language{} converts your formula to a compiled
function so that the results can be computed
quickly and efficiently.
}{
\spadgraph{draw(sin(tan(x)) - tan(sin(x)),x = 0..6)}
}{
% window was 300 x 300
\epsffile[0 0 295 295]{2D1VarA.ps}
}

Notice that \Language{} compiled the function before the graph was put
on the screen.

\psXtc{
Here is the same graph on a different interval.
This time we give the graph a title.
}{
\spadgraph{draw(sin(tan(x)) - tan(sin(x)),x = 10..16)}
}{
%window was 300 x 300
\epsffile[0 0 295 295]{2D1VarB.ps}
}
%
Once again the formula is converted to a compiled function before
any points were computed.
If you want to graph the same function on several intervals, it is
a good idea to define the function first so that the function has
to be compiled only once.
\xtc{
This time we first define the function.
}{
\spadcommand{f(x) == (x-1)*(x-2)*(x-3) \bound{f}}
}
\psXtc{
To draw the function, the first argument is its name
and the second is just the range with no independent variable.
}{
\spadgraph{draw(f, 0..4) \free{f}}
}{
% window was 300 x 300

% *********************************************************************
\head{subsection}{Plotting Two-Dimensional Parametric Plane Curves}{ugGraphTwoDPar}
% *********************************************************************

The second kind of \twodim{} graph is that of
\index{parametric plane curve}
curves produced by parametric equations.
\index{curve!parametric plane}
Let \spad{x = f(t)} and \spad{y = g(t)} be formulas or two
functions \spad{f} and \spad{g} as the parameter \spad{t} ranges
over an interval \spad{[a,b]}.
The function \spadfun{curve} takes the two functions \spad{f} and
\spad{g} as its parameters.

\beginImportant
The general format for drawing a \twodim{} plane curve defined by
parametric formulas \spad{x = f(t)} and \spad{y = g(t)} is:
%
\begin{center}
{\tt draw(curve(f(t), g(t)), t = a..b, {\it options})}
\end{center}
where \spad{a..b} defines the range of the independent variable \spad{t},
and where {\it options} prescribes zero or more options as
described in \spadref{ugGraphThreeDOptions}.
An example of an option is \spad{curveColor == bright red().}
\endImportant

Here's an example:

\psXtc{
Define a parametric curve using a range involving
\spad{%pi}, \Language{}'s way of saying \texht{$\pi$}{``pi''}.
For parametric curves, \Language{} compiles two
functions, one for each of the functions \spad{f} and \spad{g}.
}{
\spadgraph{draw(curve(sin(t)*sin(2*t)*sin(3*t), sin(4*t)*sin(5*t)*sin(6*t)), t = 0..2*\%pi)}
}{
% window was 300 x 300
\epsffile[0 0 295 295]{2DppcA.ps}
}
%
%
\psXtc{
The title may be an arbitrary string and is an
optional argument to the \spadfun{draw} command.
}{
\spadgraph{draw(curve(cos(t), sin(t)), t = 0..2*\%pi)}
}{
% window was 300 x 300
\epsffile[0 0 295 295]{2DppcB.ps}
}
%
If you plan on plotting \spad{x = f(t)}, \spad{y = g(t)} as \spad{t} ranges over
several intervals, you may want to define functions \spad{f} and \spad{g} first, so
that they need not be recompiled every time you create a new graph.
Here's an example:
\xtc{
As before, you can first define the functions you wish to draw.
}{
\spadcommand{f(t:DFLOAT):DFLOAT == sin(3*t/4) \bound{f}}
}
\xtc{
\Language{} compiles them to map \spadtype{DoubleFloat}
values to \spadtype{DoubleFloat} values.
}{
\spadcommand{g(t:DFLOAT):DFLOAT == sin(t) \bound{g}}
}

\psXtc{
Give to {\tt curve} the names of the functions,
then write the range without the name of the
independent variable.
}{
\spadgraph{draw(curve(f,g),0..\%pi) \free{f g}}
}{
% window was 300 x 300
\epsffile[0 0 295 295]{2DppcC.ps}
}
%
%
\psXtc{
Here is another look at the same curve but over a different
range. Notice that \spad{f} and \spad{g} are not recompiled.
Also note that \Language{} provides a default title based on
the first function specified in \spadfun{curve}.
}{
\spadgraph{draw(curve(f,g),-4*\%pi..4*\%pi) \free{f g}}
}{
% window was 300 x 300

% *********************************************************************
\head{subsection}{Plotting Plane Algebraic Curves}{ugGraphTwoDPlane}
% *********************************************************************

A third kind of \twodim{} graph is a non-singular ``solution curve''
\index{curve!plane algebraic}
in a rectangular region of the plane.
A solution curve is a curve defined by a polynomial equation
\spad{p(x,y) = 0}.
\index{plane algebraic curve}
Non-singular means that the curve is ``smooth'' in that it does not
cross itself or come to a point (cusp).
Algebraically, this means that for any point \spad{(x,y)} on the curve,
that is, a point such that \spad{p(x,y) = 0}, the partial derivatives
\begin{texonly}
  $\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}(x,y)$ and
  $\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}(x,y)$
\end{texonly}
\begin{htonly}
\spad{dp/dx(x,y)} and \spad{dp/dy(a,b)}
\end{htonly}
are not both zero.
\index{curve!smooth}
\index{curve!non-singular}
\index{smooth curve}
\index{non-singular curve}

%
\beginImportant
The general format for drawing a non-singular solution curve
given by a polynomial of the form \spad{p(x,y) = 0} is:
%
\begin{center}
{\tt draw(p(x,y) = 0, x, y, range == [a..b, c..d], {\it options})}
\end{center}
where the second and third arguments name the first and second
independent variables of \spad{p}.
A {\tt range} option is always given to designate a bounding
rectangular region of the plane
\texht{$a \leq x \leq b, c \leq y\leq d$}{a <= x <= b, c <= y <= d}.
Zero or more additional options as described in
\spadref{ugGraphTwoDOptions} may be given.
\endImportant

\xtc{
We require that the polynomial has rational or integral coefficients.
Here is an algebraic curve example (``Cartesian ovals''):
\index{Cartesian!ovals}
}{
\spadcommand{p := ((x^2 + y^2 + 1) - 8*x)^2 - (8*(x^2 + y^2 + 1)-4*x-1) \bound{p}}
}

\psXtc{
The first argument is always expressed as an equation of the form \spad{p = 0}
where \spad{p} is a polynomial.
}{
\spadgraph{draw(p = 0, x, y, range == [-1..11, -7..7]) \free{p}}
}{
% window was 300 x 300
\epsffile[0 0 295 295]{2DpacA.ps}
}

% *********************************************************************
\head{subsection}{Two-Dimensional Options}{ugGraphTwoDOptions}
% *********************************************************************

The \spadfun{draw} commands take an optional list of options,
such as {\tt title} shown above.
Each option is given by the syntax: {\it name} {\tt ==} {\it value}.
Here is a list of the available options in the order that they are
described below.

\begin{texonly}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
adaptive&clip&unit\\
clip&curveColor&range\\

\begin{htonly}
\table{ {adaptive} {clip} {unit} {clip} {curveColor} {range}
{toScale} {pointColor} {coordinates}}
\end{htonly}

The \spad{adaptive} option turns adaptive plotting on or off.
\index{adaptive plotting}
Adaptive plotting uses an algorithm that traverses a graph and computes
more points for those parts of the graph with high curvature.
The higher the curvature of a region is, the more points the algorithm
computes.

The domain \spadtype{Color}
\exptypeindex{Color}
provides operations for manipulating
\index{graphics!color}
colors in \twodim{} graphs.
\index{color}
Colors are objects of \spadtype{Color}.
Each color has a {\it hue} and a {\it weight}.
\index{hue}
Hues are represented by integers that range from \spad{1} to the
\spadfunFrom{numberOfHues()}{Color}, normally
\index{graphics!color!number of hues}
\spad{27}.
%\footnote{Use \spadfun{colorDef} to
%change these values to any range you want for a given \threedim{} viewport}
\index{weight}
Weights are floats and  have the value \spad{1.0} by default.
%
\begin{description}
%
\item[\spadfun{color}]\funArgs{integer}
creates a color of hue {\it integer} and weight \spad{1.0}.

%
\item[\subscriptIt{color}{1} {\tt +} \subscriptIt{color}{2}] returns the
color that results from additively combining the indicated
\subscriptIt{color}{1} and \subscriptIt{color}{2}.
Color addition is not commutative: changing the order of the arguments
produces different results.
%
\item[{\it integer} {\tt *} {\it color}]
changes the weight of {\it color} by {\it integer}
without affecting its hue.
\index{graphics!color!multiply function}
For example,
\spad{red() + 3*yellow()} produces a color closer to yellow than to red.
Color multiplication is not associative: changing the order of grouping

\head{subsection}{Addendum: Building Two-Dimensional Graphs}{ugGraphTwoDbuild}
% *********************************************************************

In this section we demonstrate how to create \twodim{} graphs from
lists of points and give an example showing how to read the lists
of points from a file.

% *********************************************************************
\subsubsection{Creating a Two-Dimensional Viewport from a List of Points}
% *********************************************************************

\Language{} creates lists of points in a \twodim{} viewport by utilizing
the \spadtype{GraphImage} and \spadtype{TwoDimensionalViewport} domains.
In this example, the \spadfunFrom{makeGraphImage}{GraphImage}
function takes a list of lists of points parameter, a list of colors for
each point in the graph, a list of colors for each line in the graph, and
a list of sizes for each point in the graph.
%
\xtc{
The following expressions create a list of lists of points which will be read
by \Language{} and made into a \twodim{} viewport.
}{
\spadcommand{p1 := point [1,1]\$(Point DFLOAT) \bound{p1}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{p2 := point [0,1]\$(Point DFLOAT) \bound{p2}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{p3 := point [0,0]\$(Point DFLOAT) \bound{p3}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{p4 := point [1,0]\$(Point DFLOAT) \bound{p4}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{p5 := point [1,.5]\$(Point DFLOAT) \bound{p5}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{p6 := point [.5,0]\$(Point DFLOAT) \bound{p6}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{p7 := point [0,0.5]\$(Point DFLOAT) \bound{p7}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{p8 := point [.5,1]\$(Point DFLOAT) \bound{p8}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{p9 := point [.25,.25]\$(Point DFLOAT) \bound{p9}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{p10 := point [.25,.75]\$(Point DFLOAT) \bound{p10}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{p11 := point [.75,.75]\$(Point DFLOAT) \bound{p11}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{p12 := point [.75,.25]\$(Point DFLOAT) \bound{p12}}
}
\xtc{
Finally, here is the list.
}{
\spadcommand{llp := [[p1,p2], [p2,p3], [p3,p4], [p4,p1], [p5,p6], [p6,p7], [p7,p8], [p8,p5], [p9,p10], [p10,p11], [p11,p12], [p12,p9]] \free{p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 p7 p8 p9 p10 p11 p12} \bound{llp}}
}
\xtc{
Now we set the point sizes for all components of the graph.
}{
\spadcommand{size1 := 6::PositiveInteger \bound{size1}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{size2 := 8::PositiveInteger \bound{size2}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{size3 := 10::PositiveInteger \bound{size3}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{lsize := [size1, size1, size1, size1, size2, size2, size2, size2, size3, size3, size3, size3] \bound{lsize} \free{size1 size2 size3}}
}
\xtc{
Here are the colors for the points.
}{
\spadcommand{pc1 := pastel red() \bound{pc1}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{pc2 := dim green() \bound{pc2}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{pc3 := pastel yellow() \bound{pc3}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{lpc := [pc1, pc1, pc1, pc1, pc2, pc2, pc2, pc2, pc3, pc3, pc3, pc3] \free{pc1 pc2 pc3} \bound{lpc}}
}
\xtc{
Here are the colors for the lines.
}{
\spadcommand{lc := [pastel blue(), light yellow(), dim green(), bright red(), light green(), dim yellow(), bright blue(), dark red(), pastel red(), light blue(), dim green(), light yellow()] \bound{lc}}
}
\xtc{
Now the \spadtype{GraphImage} is created according to the component
specifications indicated above.
}{
\spadcommand{g := makeGraphImage(llp,lpc,lc,lsize)\$GRIMAGE \bound{g} \free{llp lpc lc lsize}}
}
\psXtc{
The \spadfunFrom{makeViewport2D}{TwoDimensionalViewport} function now
creates a \spadtype{TwoDimensionalViewport} for this graph according to the
list of options specified within the brackets.
}{
\spadgraph{makeViewport2D(g,[title("Lines")])\$VIEW2D \free{g}}
}{
%
}
%See Figure #.#.
\xtc{
This example demonstrates the use of the \spadtype{GraphImage} functions
\spadfunFrom{component}{GraphImage} and \spadfunFrom{appendPoint}{GraphImage}
in adding points to an empty \spadtype{GraphImage}.
}{
\spadcommand{)clear all \bound{clearAll}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{g := graphImage()\$GRIMAGE \bound{Sg}\free{clearAll}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{p1 := point [0,0]\$(Point DFLOAT) \bound{Sp1}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{p2 := point [.25,.25]\$(Point DFLOAT) \bound{Sp2}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{p3 := point [.5,.5]\$(Point DFLOAT) \bound{Sp3}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{p4 := point [.75,.75]\$(Point DFLOAT) \bound{Sp4}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{p5 := point [1,1]\$(Point DFLOAT) \bound{Sp5}}

\spadcommand{appendPoint(g,p5)\$GRIMAGE\free{gp4 Sp5}\bound{gp5}}

Here is the graph.
}{
\spadgraph{makeViewport2D(g,[title("Graph Points")])\$VIEW2D \free{Sg gp5}}
}{
%
}
%
%See Figure #.#.
%
\xtc{
A list of points can also be made into a \spadtype{GraphImage} by using
the operation \spadfunFrom{coerce}{GraphImage}.  It is equivalent to adding
each point to \spad{g2} using \spadfunFrom{component}{GraphImage}.
}{
\spadcommand{g2 := coerce([[p1],[p2],[p3],[p4],[p5]])\$GRIMAGE  \free{Sp1 Sp2 Sp3 Sp4 Sp5} \bound{Sg2}}

}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{options(v,[title("Just Points")])\$VIEW2D \free{Sv}\bound{Svo}}
}
\xtc{
Place the graph into the viewport.
}{
\spadcommand{putGraph(v,g2,1)\$VIEW2D \free{Sg2 Svo}\bound{Svog2}}
}
\psXtc{
Take a look.
}{
\spadgraph{makeViewport2D(v)\$VIEW2D \free{Svog2}}

% *********************************************************************
\subsubsection{Creating a Two-Dimensional Viewport of a List of Points from a File}
% *********************************************************************

The following three functions read a list of points from a
file and then draw the points and the connecting lines. The
points are stored in the file in readable form as floating point numbers
(specifically, \spadtype{DoubleFloat} values) as an alternating
stream of \spad{x}- and \spad{y}-values. For example,
\begin{verbatim}
0.0 0.0     1.0 1.0     2.0 4.0
3.0 9.0     4.0 16.0    5.0 25.0
\end{verbatim}

\begin{xmpLines}
drawPoints(lp:List Point DoubleFloat):VIEW2D ==
  g := graphImage()$GRIMAGE
  for p in lp repeat
    component(g,p,pointColorDefault(),lineColorDefault(),
      pointSizeDefault())
  makeViewport2D(g,[title("Points")])$VIEW2D

drawLines(lp:List Point DoubleFloat):VIEW2D ==
  g := graphImage()$GRIMAGE
  component(g, lp, pointColorDefault(), lineColorDefault(),
    pointSizeDefault())$GRIMAGE
  makeViewport2D(g,[title("Points")])$VIEW2D

plotData2D(name, title) ==
  f:File(DFLOAT) := open(name,"input")
  lp:LIST(Point DFLOAT) := empty()
  while ((x := readIfCan!(f)) case DFLOAT) repeat
    y : DFLOAT := read!(f)
    lp := cons(point [x,y]$(Point DFLOAT), lp)
    lp
  close!(f)
  drawPoints(lp)
  drawLines(lp)
\end{xmpLines}
%
This command will actually create the viewport and the graph if
the point data is in the file \spad{"file.data"}.
\begin{xmpLines}
plotData2D("file.data", "2D Data Plot")
\end{xmpLines}

\head{subsection}{Addendum: Appending a Graph to a Viewport Window Containing a Graph}{ugGraphTwoDappend}
% *********************************************************************

This section demonstrates how to append a \twodim{} graph to a viewport
already containing other graphs.
The default \spadfun{draw} command places a graph into the first
\spadtype{GraphImage} slot position of the \spadtype{TwoDimensionalViewport}.

\xtc{
This graph is in the first slot in its viewport.
}{
\spadcommand{v1 := draw(sin(x),x=0..2*\%pi) \bound{v1}}
}
\xtc{
So is this graph.
}{
\spadcommand{v2 := draw(cos(x),x=0..2*\%pi, curveColor==light red()) \bound{v2}}
}
\xtc{
The operation \spadfunFrom{getGraph}{TwoDimensionalViewport}
retrieves the \spadtype{GraphImage} \spad{g1} from the first slot position
in the viewport \spad{v1}.
}{
\spadcommand{g1 := getGraph(v1,1) \bound{g1}\free{v1}}
}
\xtc{
Now \spadfunFrom{putGraph}{TwoDimensionalViewport}
places \spad{g1} into the the second slot position of \spad{v2}.
}{
\spadcommand{putGraph(v2,g1,2) \bound{v22}\free{g1 v2}}
}
\psXtc{
Display the new \spadtype{TwoDimensionalViewport} containing both graphs.
}{
\spadgraph{makeViewport2D(v2) \free{v22}}
}{
%
}
Instead of using \spadfun{draw} to draw a graph and then extract
graph data we can use \spadfun{makeObject}.
\xtc{
First graph.
}{
\spadcommand{g3 := makeObject(sin(x),x=-1..\%pi,[]) \bound{g3}}
}
\xtc{
This graph is in the first slot in its viewport.
}{
\spadcommand{v3 := draw(cos(x),x=-1..\%pi, curveColor==light red()) \bound{v3}}
}
\xtc{
Now \spadfunFrom{putGraph}{TwoDimensionalViewport}
places \spad{g3} into the the second slot position of \spad{v3}.
}{
\spadcommand{putGraph(v3,g3,2) \bound{v33}\free{g3 v3}}
}
\psXtc{
Display the new \spadtype{TwoDimensionalViewport} containing both graphs.

we close them.
}{
\spadcommand{close(v1); close(v2); close(v3) \free{v1 v2 v3}}

\head{section}{Three-Dimensional Graphics}{ugGraphThreeD}
% *********************************************************************
%
The \Language{} \threedim{} graphics package provides the ability to
\index{graphics!three-dimensional}
%
\begin{itemize}
%
\item generate surfaces defined by a function of two real variables
%
\item generate space curves and tubes defined by parametric equations
%
\item generate surfaces defined by parametric equations
\end{itemize}
These graphs can be modified by using various options, such as calculating

\head{subsection}{Plotting Three-Dimensional Functions of Two Variables}{ugGraphThreeDPlot}
% *********************************************************************

\index{surface!two variable function}
The simplest \threedim{} graph is that of a surface defined by a function
of two variables, \spad{z = f(x,y)}.

%
\beginImportant
The general format for drawing a surface defined by a formula \spad{f(x,y)}
of two variables \spad{x} and \spad{y} is:
%
\begin{center}
{\tt draw(f(x,y), x = a..b, y = c..d, {\it options})}
\end{center}
where \spad{a..b} and \spad{c..d} define the range of \spad{x}
and \spad{y}, and where {\it options} prescribes zero or more
options as described in \spadref{ugGraphThreeDOptions}.
An example of an option is \spad{title == "Title of Graph".}
An alternative format involving a function \spad{f} is also
available.
\endImportant

%
\psXtc{
The simplest way to plot a function of two variables is to use a formula.
With formulas you always precede the range specifications with
the variable name and an \spadSyntax{=} sign.
Notice that \Language{} uses the text of your function as a
default title.
}{
\spadgraph{draw(cos(x*y),x=-3..3,y=-3..3)}
}{
% window was 300 x 300
\epsffile[0 0 295 295]{3D2VarA.ps}
}
%
\xtc{
If you intend to use a function more than once,
or it is long and complex, then first
give its definition to \Language{}.
}{
\spadcommand{f(x,y) == sin(x)*cos(y) \bound{f}}
}
%
%
\psXtc{
To draw the function, just give its name and drop the variables
from the range specifications.
\Language{} compiles your function for efficient computation
of data for the graph.

An alternate way to create multiple graphs is to use
\spadfun{makeObject}.
The \spadfun{makeObject} command is similar to the \spadfun{draw}
command, except that it returns a three-space object rather than a
\spadtype{ThreeDimensionalViewport}.
In fact, \spadfun{makeObject} is called by the \spadfun{draw}
command to create the \spadtype{ThreeSpace} then
\spadfunFrom{makeViewport3D}{ThreeDimensionalViewport} to create a
viewport window.

\xtc{

\spadcommand{m(u:DFLOAT,v:DFLOAT):DFLOAT == 1 \bound{m}}

Do the last example a new way.
First use \spadfun{makeObject} to

}
\noOutputXtc{
Create and display a viewport

}{
\spadgraph{makeViewport3D(sph,"Multiple Objects") \free{v1}}

Note that an undefined \spadtype{ThreeSpace} parameter declared in a
\spadfun{makeObject} or \spadfun{draw} command results in an error.
Use the \spadfunFrom{create3Space}{ThreeSpace} function to define a
\spadtype{ThreeSpace}, or obtain a \spadtype{ThreeSpace} that has been
previously generated before including it in a command line.

What happened?
The option {\tt coordinates == cartesian} directs \Language{} to
treat the dependent variable \spad{m} defined by
\texht{$m=u^2$}{m=u^2} as the \spad{x} coordinate.
Thus the triplet of values \spad{(m, u, v)} is transformed to
coordinates \spad{(x, y, z)} and so we get the graph of
\texht{$x=y^2$}{x=y^2}.

Here is another example.
The \spadfunFrom{cylindrical}{CoordinateSystems} transform takes
\index{coordinate system!cylindrical}
input of the form \spad{(w,u,v)}, interprets it in the order
\index{cylindrical coordinate system}
\texht{($r$,$\theta$,$z$)}{(\spad{r}, \spad{theta}, \spad{z})}
and maps it to the Cartesian coordinates
\begin{texonly}
$x=r\cos(\theta)$, $y=r\sin(\theta)$, $z=z$
\end{texonly}
\begin{htonly}
\spad{x = r * cos(theta)}, \spad{y = r * sin(theta)}, \spad{z = z}
\end{htonly}
in which
\texht{$r$}{\spad{r}} is the radius,
\texht{$\theta$}{\spad{theta}} is the angle and
\texht{$z$}{\spad{z}} is the z-coordinate.

Suppose you would like to specify \smath{z} as a function of
\smath{r} and \texht{$\theta$}{\spad{theta}} instead of just
\smath{r}?
Well, you still can use the \spadfun{cylindrical} \Language{}
transformation but we have to reorder the triplet before
passing it to the transformation.

\xtc{
First, let's create a point to
work with and call it \spad{pt} with some color \spad{col}.
}{
\spadcommand{col := 5 \bound{c}}
}
\xtc{
}{
\spadcommand{pt := point[1,2,3,col]\$(Point DFLOAT) \free{c} \bound{pt}}
}
The reordering you want is
\texht{$(z,r, \theta)$}{\spad{(z,r,theta)}} to
\texht{$(r, \theta,z)$}{\spad{(r,theta,z)}}
so that the first element is moved to the third element, while the second
and third elements move forward and the color element does not change.
\xtc{
Define a function \userfun{reorder} to reorder the point elements.
}{
\spadcommand{reorder(p:Point DFLOAT):Point DFLOAT == point[p.2, p.3, p.1, p.4] \bound{freo}}
}
\xtc{
The function moves the second and third elements
forward but the color does not change.
}{
\spadcommand{reorder pt \free{pt freo}}
}
\xtc{
The function \userfun{newmap} converts our reordered version of
the cylindrical coordinate system to the standard
\texht{$(x,y,z)$}{\spad{(x,y,z)}} Cartesian system.
}{

\subsubsection{Transformations}
% *********************************************************************

We recommend you first select the {\bf Bounds} button while
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!transformations}
executing transformations since the bounding box displayed
indicates the object's position as it changes.
%
\begin{description}
%
\item[Rotate:]  A rotation transformation occurs by clicking the mouse
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!rotate}
within the {\bf Rotate} window in the upper left corner of the
control-panel.
The rotation is computed in spherical coordinates, using the
horizontal mouse position to increment or decrement the value of
the longitudinal angle \texht{$\theta$}{\spad{theta}} within the
range of 0 to \texht{2$\pi$}{2*pi} and the vertical mouse position
to increment or decrement the value of the latitudinal angle
\spad{phi} within the range of \texht{-$\pi$}{pi}
to \texht{$\pi$}{pi}.
The active mode of rotation is displayed in green on a color
monitor or in clear text on a black and white monitor, while the
inactive mode is displayed in red for color display or a mottled
pattern for black and white.
%
\begin{description}
%
\item[origin:]  The {\bf origin} button indicates that the
rotation is to occur with respect to the origin of the viewing space, that is
indicated by the axes.
%
\item[object:]  The {\bf object} button indicates that the
rotation is to occur with respect to the center of volume of the object,
independent of the axes' origin position.
\end{description}
%
\item[Scale:]  A scaling transformation occurs by clicking the mouse
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!scale}
within the {\bf Scale} window in the upper center of the
control-panel, containing a zoom arrow.
The axes along which the scaling is to occur are indicated by
selecting the appropriate button above the zoom arrow window.
The selected axes are displayed in green on a color monitor or in
clear text on a black and white monitor, while the unselected axes
are displayed in red for a color display or a mottled pattern for
black and white.
%
\begin{description}
%
\item[uniform:]  Uniform scaling along the {\tt x}, {\tt y}
and {\tt z} axes occurs when all the axes buttons are selected.
%
\item[non-uniform:]  If any of the axes buttons are
not selected, non-uniform scaling occurs, that is, scaling occurs only in the
direction of the axes that are selected.
\end{description}
%
\item[Translate:]  Translation occurs by indicating with the mouse in the
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!translate}
{\bf Translate} window the direction you want the graph to move.
This window is located in the upper right corner of the
control-panel and contains a potentiometer with crossed arrows
pointing up, down, left and right.
Along the top of the {\bf Translate} window are three buttons
({\bf XY},
{\bf XZ}, and {\bf YZ}) indicating the three orthographic projection planes.
Each orientates the group as a view into that plane.
Any translation of the graph occurs only along this plane.
\end{description}

% *********************************************************************
\subsubsection{Messages}
% *********************************************************************
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!messages}

The window directly below the potentiometer windows for transformations is
used to display system messages relating to the viewport, the control-panel
and the current graph displaying status.

% *********************************************************************
\subsubsection{Colormap}
% *********************************************************************
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!color map}

Directly below the message window is the colormap range indicator
window.
\index{colormap}
The \Language{} Colormap shows a sampling of the spectrum from
which hues can be drawn to represent the colors of a surface.
The Colormap is composed of five shades for each of the hues along
this spectrum.
By moving the markers above and below the Colormap, the range of
hues that are used to color the existing surface are set.
The bottom marker shows the hue for the low end of the color range
and the top marker shows the hue for the upper end of the range.
Setting the bottom and top markers at the same hue results in
monochromatic smooth shading of the graph when {\bf Smooth} mode is selected.
At each end of the Colormap are {\bf +} and {\bf -} buttons.
When clicked on, these increment or decrement the top or bottom
marker.

% *********************************************************************
\subsubsection{Buttons}
% *********************************************************************
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!buttons}

Below the Colormap window and to the left are located various
buttons that determine the characteristics of a graph.
The buttons along the bottom and right hand side all have special
meanings; the remaining buttons in the first row indicate the mode
or style used to display the graph.
The second row are toggles that turn on or off a property of the
graph.
On a color monitor, the property is on if green (clear text, on a
monochrome monitor) and off if red (mottled pattern, on a
monochrome monitor).
Here is a list of their functions.
%
\begin{description}
%
\item[Wire] displays surface and tube plots as a
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!wire}
wireframe image in a single color (blue) with no hidden surfaces removed,
or displays space curve plots in colors based upon their parametric variables.
This is the fastest mode for displaying a graph.
This is very useful when you
want to find a good orientation of your graph.
%
\item[Solid] displays the graph with hidden
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!solid}
surfaces removed, drawing each polygon beginning with the furthest
from the viewer.
The edges of the polygons are displayed in the hues specified by
the range in the Colormap window.
%
\item[Shade] displays the graph with hidden
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!shade}
surfaces removed and with the polygons shaded, drawing each
polygon beginning with the furthest from the viewer.
Polygons are shaded in the hues specified by the range in the
Colormap window using the Phong illumination model.
\index{Phong!illumination model}
%
\item[Smooth] displays the graph using a
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!smooth}
renderer that computes the graph one line at a time.
The location and color of the graph at each visible point on the
screen are determined and displayed using the Phong illumination
\index{Phong!illumination model}
model.
Smooth shading is done in one of two ways, depending on the range
selected in the colormap window and the number of colors available
from the hardware and/or window manager.
When the top and bottom markers of the colormap range are set to
different hues, the graph is rendered by dithering between the
\index{dithering}
transitions in color hue.
When the top and bottom markers of the colormap range are set to
the same hue, the graph is rendered using the Phong smooth shading
model.
\index{Phong!smooth shading model}
However, if enough colors cannot be allocated for this purpose,
the renderer reverts to the color dithering method until a
sufficient color supply is available.
For this reason, it may not be possible to render multiple Phong
smooth shaded graphs at the same time on some systems.
%
\item[Bounds] encloses the entire volume of the
viewgraph within a bounding box, or removes the box if previously selected.
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!bounds}
The region that encloses the entire volume of the viewport graph is displayed.
%
\item[Axes] displays Cartesian
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!axes}
coordinate axes of the space, or turns them off if previously selected.
%
\item[Outline] causes
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!outline}
quadrilateral polygons forming the graph surface to be outlined in black when
the graph is displayed in {\bf Shade} mode.
%
\item[BW] converts a color viewport to black and white, or vice-versa.
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!bw}
When this button is selected the
control-panel and viewport switch to an immutable colormap composed of a range
of grey scale patterns or tiles that are used wherever shading is necessary.
%
\item[Light] takes you to a control-panel described below.
%
\item[ViewVolume] takes you to another control-panel as described below.
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!save}
%
\item[Save] creates a menu of the possible file types that can
be written using the control-panel.
The {\bf Exit} button leaves the save menu.
The {\bf Pixmap} button writes an \Language{} pixmap of
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!pixmap}
the current viewport contents.  The file is called {\bf fricas3D.pixmap} and is
located in the directory from which \Language{} or {\bf viewAlone} was
started.
The {\bf PS} button writes the current viewport contents to
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!ps}
PostScript output rather than to the viewport window.
By default the file is called {\bf fricas3D.ps}; however, if a file
\index{file!.Xdefaults @{\bf .Xdefaults}}
name is specified in the user's {\bf .Xdefaults} file it is
\index{graphics!.Xdefaults!PostScript file name}
used.
The file is placed in the directory from which the \Language{} or
{\bf viewAlone} session was begun.
See also the \spadfunFrom{write}{ThreeDimensionalViewport}
function.
\index{PostScript}
%
\item[Reset] returns the object transformation
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!reset}
characteristics back to their initial states.
%
\item[Hide] causes the control-panel for the
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!hide}
corresponding viewport to disappear from the screen.
%
\item[Quit]  queries whether the current viewport
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!quit}
session should be terminated.

The {\bf Light} button changes the control-panel into the
{\bf Lighting Control-Panel}.  At the top of this panel, the three axes
are shown with the same orientation as the object.  A light vector from
the origin of the axes shows the current position of the light source
relative to the object.  At the bottom of the panel is an {\bf Abort}
button that cancels any changes to the lighting that were made, and a
{\bf Return} button that carries out the current set of lighting changes
on the graph.
%
\begin{description}
%
\item[XY:]  The {\bf XY} lighting axes window is below the
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!move xy}
{\bf Lighting Control-Panel} title and to the left.
This changes the light vector within the {\bf XY} view plane.
%
\item[Z:]  The {\bf Z} lighting axis window is below the
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!move z}
{\bf Lighting Control-Panel} title and in the center.  This
changes the {\bf Z}
location of the light vector.
%
\item[Intensity:]
Below the {\bf Lighting Control-Panel} title
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!intensity}
and to the right is the light intensity meter.
Moving the intensity indicator down decreases the amount of
light emitted from the light source.
When the indicator is at the top of the meter the light source is
emitting at 100\% intensity.
At the bottom of the meter the light source is emitting at a level
slightly above ambient lighting.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{View Volume}
% *********************************************************************
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!view volume}

The {\bf View Volume} button changes the control-panel into
the {\bf Viewing Volume Panel}.
At the bottom of the viewing panel is an {\bf Abort} button that

{\it Return} button that carries out the current set of
viewing changes to the graph.

\begin{description}
%
\item[Eye Reference:]  At the top of this panel is the
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!eye reference}
{\bf Eye Reference} window.
It shows a planar projection of the viewing pyramid from the eye
of the viewer relative to the location of the object.
This has a bounding region represented by the rectangle on the
left.
Below the object rectangle is the {\bf Hither} window.
By moving the slider in this window the hither clipping plane sets
\index{hither clipping plane}
the front of the view volume.
As a result of this depth clipping all points of the object closer
to the eye than this hither plane are not shown.
The {\bf Eye Distance} slider to the right of the {\bf Hither}
slider is used to change the degree of perspective in the image.
%
\item[Clip Volume:]  The {\bf Clip Volume} window is at the
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!clip volume}
bottom of the {\bf Viewing Volume Panel}.
On the right is a {\bf Settings} menu.
In this menu are buttons to select viewing attributes.
Selecting the {\bf Perspective} button computes the image using
perspective projection.
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!perspective}
The {\bf Show Region} button indicates whether the clipping region
of the
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!show clip region}
volume is to be drawn in the viewport and the {\bf Clipping On}
button shows whether the view volume clipping is to be in effect
when the image
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!clipping on}
is drawn.
The left side of the {\bf Clip Volume} window shows the clipping
\index{graphics!3D control-panel!clip volume}
boundary of the graph.
Moving the knobs along the {\bf X}, {\bf Y}, and {\bf Z} sliders
adjusts the volume of the clipping region accordingly.

Both the \twodim{} and \threedim{} drawing facilities consult
the {\bf .Xdefaults} file for various defaults.
\index{file!.Xdefaults @{\bf .Xdefaults}}
The list of defaults that are recognized by the graphing routines
is discussed in this section.
These defaults are preceded by {\tt FriCAS.3D.}
for \threedim{} viewport defaults, {\tt FriCAS.2D.}
for \twodim{} viewport defaults, or {\tt FriCAS*} (no dot) for
those defaults that are acceptable to either viewport type.
