S2CD0003
 %x3 %1 The constructor %2b is missing the heading description.
S2CD0004
 %x3 %1 The following functions do not have documentation:
S2CD0005
 %x3 %1 The following attributes do not have documentation:
S2CD0006
 %1 The constructor %2b has incorrectly placed documentation.
S2IA0001
 Division by zero on conversion to GaloisField.
S2IB0001
 An expression following %1b must evaluate to a %b Boolean %d and you
 have written one that does not.
S2IB0002
 The function is not defined for given value.
S2IB0003
 The user-defined function %1bp cannot be applied as specified. %l
 Possible reasons: %i %l
 1. The function has been declared but not defined. %l
 2. Some arguments are functions, but they are not declared. %l
 3. The function is not being called with the correct number of
 arguments. %u
S2IB0004
 %1b is declared as being in %2bp but has not been given a value.
S2IB0006
 The argument to %b %% %d must be a single integer.
S2IB0008
 Cannot find a definition or applicable library operation named
 %1ob with argument type(s) %b %ceon %2P %ceoff %d %l
 Perhaps you should use "@" to indicate the required return type, or "$" to
 specify which version of the function you need.
S2IB0008a
 There are no library operations named %1b %l
 Use HyperDoc Browse
 or issue %ceon )what op %1 %ceoff to learn if there is any operation
 containing " %1 " in its name.
S2IB0008b
 There are no exposed library operations named %1b but there is
 one unexposed operation with that name. Use HyperDoc Browse or
 issue %ceon )display op %1 %ceoff to learn more about the available
 operation.
S2IB0008c
 There are no exposed library operations named %1b but there are
 %2b unexposed operations with that name. Use HyperDoc Browse or
 issue %ceon )display op %1 %ceoff to learn more about the available
 operations.
S2IB0008d
 There are no library operations named %1b having %2 argument(s)
 though there are %3 exposed operation(s) and %4 unexposed operation(s)
 having a different number of
 arguments. Use HyperDoc Browse, or issue
 %ceon )what op %1 %ceoff to learn what operations
 contain " %1 " in their names, or
 issue %ceon )display op %1 %ceoff to learn more about the available
 operations.
S2IB0008e
 There are no exposed library operations named %1b having %2 argument(s)
 though there are %3 unexposed operation(s) with %2 argument(s).
 Use HyperDoc Browse, or
 issue %ceon )display op %1 %ceoff to learn more about the available
 operations.
S2IB0008f
 There are %3 exposed and %4 unexposed
 library operations named %1b having %2 argument(s)
 but none was determined to be applicable.
 Use HyperDoc Browse, or
 issue %ceon )display op %1 %ceoff to learn more about the available
 operations.
 Perhaps package-calling the operation or using coercions on the
 arguments will allow you to apply the operation.
S2IB0009
 FriCAS will attempt to step through and interpret the code.
S2IB0010
 Cannot resolve type of value and declared partial type.
S2IB0011
 Cannot find a no-argument definition or library operation named %1b .
S2IB0012
 Cannot find application of object of type %1b to argument(s) of type(s)
 %b %ceon %2 %ceoff %d
S2IB0013
 Cannot find application of object of type %1b .
S2IC0001
 Cannot generate conversion for argument %1b in %2b from type
 %3bp to %4bp.
S2IC0002
 Cannot convert the value from type %1bp to %2bp .
S2IC0003
 Cannot convert from type %1bp to %2bp for value %3m
S2IC0004
 Conversion failed in the compiled user function %1b from %2bp to %3bp
S2IC0005
 Conversion failed in the compiled user function %1b .
S2IC0006
 Cannot compile conversion for types involving local variables.
 In particular, could not compile the expression involving %b :: %1p %d
S2IC0007
 Cannot convert an element of the construct to type %1bp .
S2IC0008
 No such constant %1b in domain %2bp .
S2IC0009
 You are trying to use something (probably a loop) in a situation where a
 value is expected.  In particular, you are trying to convert this to the
 type %1bp . The following information may help:  possible function name:  %2p
S2IC0010
 Cannot compile target expressions for types involving local variables.
 In particular, could not compile the expression involving %b @ %1p %d
S2IC0011
 An expression involving %b @ %2p %d actually evaluated to one of
 type %1bp .  Perhaps you should use %b :: %2p %d .
S2IC0013
 Cannot determine branch of %b Union. %d
S2IC0014
 The type %1bp is not branch of %2bp
S2IC0015
 Generated code is incorrect for %b equation %d
S2ID0004
 Cannot locate %1 for %2b .
S2ID0014
 %1b depends on the unknown constructor %2b .
S2ID0015
 There is no %2 for the constructor %1b .
S2ID0022
 %b %1 %2 %d has the following missing or incorrect keys: %3b
S2IE0001
 You cannot use %1b in the manner you have because it has no value.
S2IE0002
 Though %1b has declared type (or partial type) %2bp it does not have
 an assigned value. You must give it one before it can be so used.
S2IE0003
 Although %1b is the name of a constructor, a full type must be specified
 in the context you have used it.  Issue %b )show %2 %d for more
 information.
S2IE0004
 %1bp is not a valid type.
S2IE0005
 You cannot now use %1bp in the context you have it.
S2IE0006
 Cannot convert the %1 argument of %3p to the type %2p .
S2IE0007
 Category, domain or package constructor %1b is not available.
S2IE0008
 Cannot find an applicable defined function %1b for the given arguments.
S2IE0009
 Operation %b %1 : %2 %d is not implemented in %3bp .
S2IE0010
 Your expression cannot be fully compiled because it contains an
 integer expression (for %1b ) whose sign cannot be determined (in
 general) and so must be specified by you.
 Perhaps you can try substituting something like %ceon %b ( %1 :: PI )
 %d %l or %l %b ( %1 ::  NNI ) %d %ceoff into your expression for %1b .
S2IE0011
 %1bp is a %2 , not a domain, and declarations require domains.
S2IE0012
 The right-hand side of the $ operator must be a package or domain name,
 but %1bp is a category.
S2IE0013
 The argument to the side-effect producing operation %1b is not allowed
 to be converted from type %2bp to type %3bp .
S2IE0014
 You cannot use %1bp or any other category in a target, coercion, or
 package-call context.
S2IF0001
 A $-expression must have a fully specified domain or package on the
 right-hand side.
S2IF0002
 Functions from %1b are not available yet.

 The function %1b is not defined in the domain %2bp .
S2IF0009
 The domain %1bp does not belong to the category %2bp .
S2IF0010
 %1b is not a known function.  FriCAS will try to list its functions
 which contain %1b in their names.  This is the same output you
 would get by issuing %ceon %b )what operations %1 %d %ceoff
S2IF0011
 %l To get more information about an operation such as %1b, issue the
 command %b )display op %1 %d
S2IF0012
 %1b is not the name of a system function.
S2IH0001
 You have not reached step %1b yet, and so its value cannot be
 supplied.
S2IH0002
 Cannot supply value for step %1b because 1 is the first step.
S2IH0003
 Step %1b has no value.
S2IH0004
 The history facility is not on, so you cannot use %b %% %d .
S2IH0006
 You have not used the correct syntax for the %b history %d command.
 Issue %b )help history %d for more information.
S2IH0007
 The history facility is already on.
S2IH0008

S2IH0015
 The argument %b n %d for %b )history )change n must be a nonnegative
 integer and your argument, %1b , is not one.
S2IH0016
 The history facility is not on, so no information can be saved.
S2IH0018
 The saved history file is %1b .
S2IH0019
 There is no history file, so value of step %1b is
 undefined.
S2IH0022
 No history information had been saved yet.
S2IH0023
 %1b is not a valid filename for the history file.
S2IH0024
 History information cannot be restored from %1b because the file does
 not exist.
S2IH0025
 The workspace has been successfully restored from the history file
 %1b .
S2IH0026
 The history facility command %1b cannot be performed because the
 history facility is not on.
S2IH0027
 A value containing a %1b is being saved in a history file or a
 compiled input file INLIB. This type
 is not yet usable in other history operations.  You might want to issue
 %b )history )off %d
S2IH0029
 History information is already being maintained in an external file
 (and not in memory).
S2IH0030
 History information is already being maintained in memory (and not
 in an external file).
S2IH0031
 When the history facility is active, history information will be
 maintained in a file (and not in an internal table).
S2IH0032
 When the history facility is active, history information will be
 maintained in memory (and not in an external file).
S2IH0034
 Missing element in internal history table.
S2IH0035

 %1b claims that its constructor name is the %2 %3b but %3b is already
 known to be the %d for %4 %5b .
S2IL0008
 %1b is the name of a %2 constructor from %3b .
S2IL0009
 Illegal abbreviation %1b for %b %2 %3 %d .
S2IL0010
 %1b is already an abbreviation for %b %2 %3 %d .
S2IL0011
 %1b is the name of a %2b constructor.
S2IL0012
 %1b is a %2b .
S2IL0013
 Error: %1b has value %2bp .
S2IL0014
 The constructor %1b takes %2 and you have given %3b .
S2IL0015
 %1b is an unknown constructor and so is unavailable. Did you
 mean to use %b -> %d but type something different instead?
S2IL0016
 A file with the requested source cannot be located.
S2IL0017
 Enter %b create %d to newly create the file or specify the %b correct %d
 name of the file or depress the %b ENTER %d key once or twice to cancel
 the selection:
S2IL0018
 Your request to cancel the selection has been accepted. You are now
 being returned to the top level of FriCAS.
S2IL0019
 %1b is not known to be a valid abbreviation for a constructor.
 If necessary, use the %b )abbreviation %d system command to create
 an abbreviation. Issue %b )abbreviation ? %d for more information.

S2IM0001
 The previous declaration of %1b as %2bp is incompatible with its new use
 as a function.  If you do not want the old value, issue %b )clear prop
 %1 %d.
S2IM0002
 %1b is not valid on the left-hand side of a function definition.
S2IM0003
 You have used the abbreviation %1b of the constructor %2b as an
 identifier on the left hand side of a function definition.  This is not
 allowed.
S2IM0004
 Partial types are not allowed in the declarations of
 function arguments or return types.
S2IM0005
 Invalid type expression %1b in function definition.
S2IM0006
 Function declaration %1 has been added to workspace.
S2IM0007
 All or none of the arguments and result type of %1bp must be declared.
S2IM0008
 The number of parameters in your definition for %1bp does not
 correspond to the declared number of arguments.
S2IM0009
 A loop has been detected in analyzing function/rule %1b and it cannot
 be further processed. It would probably help if you declared the function.
 The functions/rules that were being analyzed were: %l %b %2 %d
S2IM0010
 FriCAS cannot compile or interpret code for function %1b .
S2IM0011
 FriCAS cannot determine the type for function %1b . Please declare it.
S2IM0012
 FriCAS cannot determine the type of %1b because it cannot analyze the
 non-recursive part, if that exists.  This may be remedied by declaring
 the function.
S2IM0013
 You cannot use the free variable %1b before its assignment in %2bp .
S2IM0014
 Compiling body of rule %1bp to compute value of type %2b

S2IR0002
 FriCAS cannot handle %b [ ] %d here.
S2IR0003
 The types that cannot be resolved are: %1b
S2IR0004
 FriCAS is confused by what you input.  It cannot resolve the
 type %1bp with the partial type %2bp .
 Please make sure you have used the correct syntax.
S2IR0005
 The type %1bp is not valid because unions cannot include
 the same type more than once.
S2IS0001
 Cannot compile algebraic extension declarations yet.
S2IS0002
 Cannot pass to a field from the domain %1pb .
S2IS0003
 Your statement has resulted in the following assignments and
 declaration:
S2IS0004
 %b case %d is only used for Unions and the object on the left-hand side
 does not belong to a union.
S2IS0005
 The index variable in an iterator must be a symbol and %1 is not
 one.
S2IS0006
 FriCAS cannot iterate with %1b over your form now.
 Perhaps you should try using a conversion to make sure your form is
 a list or stream, for example.
S2IS0007
 The %1 bound in a loop must be an integer.
S2IS0008
 The step value in a loop must be a constant integer.
S2IS0009
 FriCAS can only iterate over lists now and you supplied an
 object of type %1bp .
S2IS0010
 Cannot resolve types in collect body.
S2IS0011
 Interpret-Code mode is not supported for stream bodies.
S2IS0013
 FriCAS does not understand what you mean when you specify %b [
 ] %d as having the type %1bp .
S2IS0014
 Cannot compile the declaration for %1b because its
 (possible partial) type contains a local variable.
S2IS0015
 An identifier cannot be declared to have type %b Void %d
S2IS0016
 Declarations are only allowed on variables and %1b is not one.
S2IS0017
 The previous use of %1b as a function is not compatible with its new
 declaration as %2bp . If you do not want the old value, issue %l %b
 )clear prop %1 %d
S2IS0019
 Cannot process mapping declaration on %1b since it already has a
 value.
S2IS0020
 A fully specified type must follow $ when it qualifies a domain
 constant.
S2IS0021
 There is no operation named %1b in the domain or package %2bp .
S2IS0022
 There is more than one %1b in the domain or package %2bp .
 The one being chosen has type %3bp .
S2IS0023
 The function %1b is not implemented in %2bp .
S2IS0024
 %1b is not a lisp function and so cannot be used with $Lisp.
S2IS0025
 You can only use %b has %d to query the properties of a fully
 specified type. You cannot query a category.
S2IS0026
 Cannot resolve types %1bp and %2bp across the %b then %d and %b else
 %d clauses of an %b if %d statement.
S2IS0027
 %1b is not valid on the left-hand side of an assignment
 expression.
S2IS0028
 You have used the abbreviation %1b of the constructor %2b on the
 left-hand side of an assignment expression. This is not allowed.
S2IS0029
 A(n) %1b statement may only be used within a %b repeat %d loop.
S2IS0030
 Pattern matching is only allowed on lists.
S2IS0031

S2IS0036
 Cannot convert right-hand side of assignment %1m to an object of the
 type %2bp of the left-hand side.
S2IS0037
 Cannot convert right-hand side of assignment to an object of the
 type %1bp of the left-hand side.
S2IS0038
 Assignments with tuples must have the same size tuples on each side
 of the %b := %d .
S2IS0039
 If there is a tuple on the left-hand side of an assignment then
 there must also be one on the right-hand side.
S2IS0040
 FriCAS cannot now handle assignments to scripted variables
 with more than one script.  You can use %b == %d however.
S2IS0041
 FriCAS can now only handle undeclared %b Table %d
 assignments with a single key. Try using the form %1b .
S2IS0047
 The %b return %d keyword can only be used within a function.
S2IS0048
 The use of a $-expression is not understood in this context.
S2IS0049
 %1 definition for %2b is being overwritten.
S2IS0050
 Because of its use for recalling previous results, you cannot use
 %1b as a variable name.  In particular, you cannot declare it.
S2IS0051
 A tagged union construct with %b [ %d and %b ] %d must contain only
 one element and you supplied %1b to create an object of type
 %2bp.
S2IS0052
 You cannot declare %1b to be of type %2bp because either the declared
 type of %1b or the type of the value of %1b is different from %2bp .
S2IS0053
 Interpreter code generation failed for expression %1s
S2IS0054
 Argument number %1b to %2b must be a Boolean.
S2IS0055
 The reserved word %1b is not supported yet and so ignored for variable
 %2b
S2IS0056
 Anonymous user functions created with %b +-> %d that are processed in
 interpret-code mode must have result target information available.
 This information is not present so FriCAS cannot proceed any further.
 This may be remedied by declaring the function.
S2IS0057
 All parameters to anonymous user maps must identifiers, possibly in
 combination with declarations and predicates. Constants are not
 allowed. The given expression %1b is not allowed.
S2IS0058
 Partial type declarations are not allowed for anonymous user maps.
 This also means that is you are using a %b +-> %d form in a context
 where the type is to be deduced from target information, the target
 type must not be partial.
S2IS0059
 You entered an incomplete signature for an anonymous user function.
 You must either declare the type types of the rest and all the arguments
 or you  must declare the types of none of them.
S2IS0060
 The form on the left hand side of an assignment must be a single variable,
 a Tuple of variables or a  reference to an entry in an object supporting
 the setelt operation.
S2IS0061
 There is no operation named %1b with type %2p in the domain or
 package %3p.
S2IT0001
 %1b can have no other options.
S2IT0002
 Trace facility timers, space counts and execution counts have been
 reset.
S2IT0003
 Please retrace the domain %1b.
S2IT0004
 %b )ops %d and %b )of %d cannot both be options to %b )trace %d
S2IT0005
 The %1b option is not implemented yet.
S2IT0006
 %1 The %b )trace %d option %b )only %d does not permit %2b as a legal
 option.
S2IT0007
 %1 FriCAS does not understand the %b )trace %d option %2b which you used.
S2IT0008
 %1 The %b )trace %d option %b )break %d can only have one or both of
 %b before %d and %b after %d as arguments.
S2IT0009
 %1 The %b )trace %d option %2b can have no arguments.
S2IT0010
 %1 The %b )trace %d option %2b takes exactly one name as an argument.
S2IT0011
 %1 The %b )trace %d option %2b takes exactly one expression as an
 argument.
S2IT0012
 %1 The %b )trace %d option %2b takes exactly one integer argument.
S2IT0013
 %1 The %b )trace %d option %b )of %d should be followed by the name of a
 domain and %2b is not one.
S2IT0015
 %1 The %b )trace %d option %2b should be followed by a list of names.
S2IT0016
 %1 The %b )trace %d option %2b should be followed by a list of variable
 names.
S2IT0017
 There are %1b problems with your %b )trace %d system command:
S2IT0018
 FriCAS does not understand the use of %1b here.
S2IT0019
 If you use the %b )off %d option for %b )trace %d and you also use
 the %b )local %d or %b )ops %d option, you must specify the name
 of a constructor.  You have not done so.
S2IT0020
 If you use the %b )off %d option for %b )trace %d and you also use
 the %b )local %d or %b )ops %d option, you must specify the name
 of a constructor.  What you gave after %b )trace %d is not a valid
 constructor name.
S2IT0021
 If you use the %b )off %d option for %b )trace %d then the only other
 options you can use are %b )nonquietly, )ops %d and %b )local. %d
S2IU0001
 %1 will be automatically loaded when needed from %2
S2IU0002
 Ignoring )dir because an explicit directory was not given after )dir.
S2IU0003
 The %b )load %d system command is obsolete. Please use the %b )library %d
 command instead.
S2IV0001
 %b )set streams calculate %d is used to tell FriCAS
 how many elements of a stream to calculate when a
 computation uses the stream.  The value given after %b calculate %d must
 either be the word %b all %d or a positive integer.  %l %l The current
 setting is %1b .
S2IV0002
 To toggle %1 printing on and off, specify %l
 %b )set output %2 yes/no/on/off %d %l
 Yes, no, on and off cannot be abbreviated.
S2IV0003
 It is not possible to open or create a file called %b %1 %2 %d .

 Issue %b )abbrev ? %d for more information.
S2IZ0003
 %1b is neither a constructor name nor a constructor abbreviation.
S2IZ0004
 Removing %1b as the abbreviation for %2b will also remove %3 %2b from
 the system.  Enter %b yes %d or %b y %d if this is what you want, or
 anything else to abort the removal.
S2IZ0005
 Issue %b )abbrev ? %d for more information.
S2IZ0006

S2IZ0016
 The %1b system command takes arguments but no options.
S2IZ0017
 %1b is not a valid frame name.
S2IZ0018
 You must provide a name for the new frame.
S2IZ0019
 You cannot use the name %1b for a new frame because an existing
 frame already has that name.
S2IZ0020
 There is only one frame active and therefore that cannot be closed.
 Furthermore, the frame name you gave is not the name of the current frame.
 The current frame is called %1b .
S2IZ0021
 The current frame is the only active one.  Issue %b )clear all %d to
 clear its contents.
S2IZ0022
 There is no frame called %1b and so your command cannot be
 processed.
S2IZ0024
 The names of the existing frames are: %1 %l
 The current frame is the first one listed.
S2IZ0026
 The %b )help %d system command supports at most one argument.

 and %b .as %d can now only be compiled with the %b )compile %d system command.
S2IZ0035
 The file %1b will not be added to the list of working source files
 because the file does not exist.
S2IZ0036
 %1b is an unknown or unavailable for the %b )compile %d command.
S2IZ0037
 %1b requires and argument and you do not give one.
S2IZ0038

 %b Union %d takes any number of domain arguments: %i %l
 A, a domain of category SetCategory %l
 ... %l
 B, a domain of category SetCategory %u %l
 In this untagged form of Union, domains A, ..., B must be distinct.
 In order for more information to be displayed about %1b ,
 you must give it specific arguments. For example: %2b %l
 You can also use the HyperDoc Browser.
S2IZ0046
 For more information about individual commands, use the %b )help %d
 system command followed by the command name or the command name followed
 by a question mark.  Some commands (such as %b )lisp %d ) may require
 the %b )help lisp %d format.  For example, issue %b )help help %d or %b
 )help %x1 ? %d to find out more about the help command itself.
S2IZ0047
 Arguments are not allowed for the %b )workfiles %d system command.
 The %b )boot, )lisp, )meta %d and %b )delete %d options may be used
 with this command, however. Issue %b )help workfiles %d for more
 information.
S2IZ0048
 %1b is not an allowable option for the %b )workfiles %d system command.
 The %b )boot, )lisp, )meta %d and %b )delete %d options may be used

 The following groups are explicitly exposed in the current frame
 (called %1b ):
S2IZ0049B
 The following constructors are explicitly exposed in the current frame:
S2IZ0049C
 The following constructors are explicitly hidden in the current frame:
S2IZ0049D
 When %b )set expose %d is followed by no arguments, the information
 you now see is displayed. When followed by the %b initialize %d
 argument, the exposure group data in the file %1b is read and is
 then available. The arguments %b add %d and %b drop %d are used
 to add or drop exposure groups or explicit constructors from the
 local frame exposure data.  Issue
 %ceon %b )set expose add %d %x3 or %x3 %b )set expose drop %d %ceoff
 for more information.
S2IZ0049E
 When %b )set expose add %d is followed by no arguments, the information
 you now see is displayed.
 The arguments %b group %d and %b constructor %d are used to specify
 exposure groups or an explicit constructor to be added to the local
 frame exposure data. Issue
 %ceon %b )set expose add group %d %ceoff or
 %ceon %b )set expose add constructor %d %ceoff
 for more information.
S2IZ0049F
 When %b )set expose drop %d is followed by no arguments, the information
 you now see is displayed.
 The arguments %b group %d and %b constructor %d are used to specify
 exposure groups or an explicit constructor to be dropped from the local
 frame exposure data. Issue
 %ceon %b )set expose drop group %d %ceoff or
 %ceon %b )set expose drop constructor %d %ceoff
 for more information.
S2IZ0049G
 When %b )set expose add group %d is followed by no arguments, the
 information you now see is displayed. Otherwise, the words following
 %b group %d must be valid names of exposure groups defined in
 %1b . The group %b all %d is special: using this group name causes
 all known constructors to be exposed.  The known exposure group
 names are:
S2IZ0049H
 %1b is not a known exposure group name.
S2IZ0049I
 %1b is already an exposure group for frame %2b
S2IZ0049J
 %1b is not a known constructor.
 You can make the constructor known to the system by loading it.
S2IZ0049K
 %1b is already explicitly exposed in frame %2b
S2IZ0049L
 When followed by one or more exposure group names, this option allows
 you to remove those groups from the local frame exposure data.
S2IZ0049N
 When followed by one or more constructor names, this option allows you
 to explicitly hide constructors in this frame.
S2IZ0049O
 %1b is already explicitly hidden in frame %2b
S2IZ0049P
 %1b is now explicitly exposed in frame %2b
S2IZ0049Q

S2IZ0073
 %b )frame import %d must be followed by the frame name. The names
 of objects in that frame can then optionally follow the frame name.
 For example,
 %ceon %b )frame import calculus %d %ceoff
 imports all objects in the %b calculus %d frame, and
 %ceon %b )frame import calculus epsilon delta %d %ceoff
 imports the objects named %b epsilon %d and %b delta %d from the
 frame %b calculus %d .
 Please note that if the current frame contained any information
 about objects with these names, then that information would be
 cleared before the import took place.
S2IZ0074
 You cannot import anything from the frame %1b because that is not
 the name of an existing frame.
S2IZ0075
 You cannot import from the current frame (nor is there a need!).
S2IZ0076
 User verification required:
 do you really want to import everything from the frame %1b ?
 If so, please enter %b y %d or %b yes %d :
S2IZ0077
 On your request, FriCAS will not import everything from frame %1b .
S2IZ0078
 Import from frame %1b is complete. Please issue %b )display all %d
 if you wish to see the contents of the current frame.
S2IZ0079
 FriCAS cannot import %1b from frame %2b because it cannot be found.
S2IZ0080
