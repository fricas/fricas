This directory contains material to allow programs written in Aldor
to be run inside FriCAS.

The original programs and Makefiles in this directory are due to
Peter Broadbery. Without his initial work and his help I would not have
been able to come so far.

See http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org/AldorForAxiom and especially
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2008-01/msg00033.html.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Compilation currently is supposed to work as follows:

  mkdir fricas
  cd fricas
  FRICASSVN=https://fricas.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fricas
  svn co $FRICASSVN/branches/aldor-interface fricas-src
  mkdir fricas-build
  cd fricas-build
  ../fricas-src/configure
  # Write
  # ../fricas-src/configure --prefix=/some/where/else
  # if you want to install somewhere else but not in /usr/local
  make
  make install

After that you should be able to call FriCAS and say
  )co somefile.as
and use the content of that file in your FriCAS session.

The interface to Aldor will only be built if 'configure' can find an
aldor executable and certain aldor files. The environment variable
ALDORROOT must be set.

Possible issues:
----------------
Since there are currently 7 non-free .as files used during the built
the build might break. The reason is that the first time 'make' is
invoked, it will try to extract the missing files from a remote Aldor
SVN repository. Once the files are on the local computer, no Internet
connection is needed. 'make' tries to get these file via SVN, but they
can also be extracted manually over http.
