This directory contains material to allow programs written in Aldor
to be run inside FriCAS.

The original programs and Makefiles in this directory are due to
Peter Broadbery. Without his initial work and his help I would not have
been able to come so far.

See http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org/AldorForAxiom and especially
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2008-01/msg00033.html.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING: THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS.
ONLY PARTS OF THE COMPILATION WORK PROPERLY.

Currently libaxiom.al and the runtime files are compiled and
will be installed into the right place when one calls
'make install'.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Compilation currently is supposed to work as follows:

  mkdir fricas
  cd fricas
  FRICASSVN=https://fricas.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fricas
  svn co $FRICASSVN/branches/aldor-interface fricas-src
  mkdir fricas-build
  cd fricas-build
  ../fricas-src/configure
  # Write
  # ../fricas-src/configure --prefix=/some/where/else
  # if you want to install somewhere else but not in /usr/local
  make
  cd src/aldor
  make
  cp axiom.as $ALDORROOT/include
  cd ../..
  make install

After that you should be able to call FriCAS and say
  )co somefile.as
and use the content of that file in your FriCAS session.
