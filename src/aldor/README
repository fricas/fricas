This directory contains material to allow programs written in Aldor
to be run inside FriCAS.

The original programs and Makefiles in this directory are due to
Peter Broadbery. Without his initial work and his help I would not have
been able to come so far.

See http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org/AldorForAxiom and especially
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2008-01/msg00033.html.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING: THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS.
ONLY PARTS OF THE COMPILATION WORK PROPERLY.

Currently libaxiom.al can be compiled, but there still must be
more fine tuning to be useful for the interoperability.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Compilation currently is supposed to work as follows:

  mkdir fricas
  cd fricas
  FRICASSVN=https://fricas.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fricas
  svn co $FRICASSVN/branches/aldor-interface fricas-src
  mkdir fricas-build
  cd fricas-build
  ../fricas-src/configure
  make
  cd src/aldor
  make

The compilation should progress until al/libaxiom.al is produced.
