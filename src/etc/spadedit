\begin{abstract}
  \verb|SPADEDIT| is a shell script that handles features to display or edit
  source files.
\end{abstract}

The script described here is called (at least) in two different situations:
\begin{itemize}
\item it is called by HyperDoc, when the user clicks on a link like
  \verb|INT.spad|. In this case it receives two arguments, namely 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item the file in which HyperDoc believes the constructur is defined, which
    is currently of the form \verb|$AXIOM/../../src/algebra/INT.spad|, i.e.,
    the path to the source directory, then the abreviation of the constructor,
    and finally \verb|.spad| appended,

  \item the long name of the constructor.
  \end{enumerate} 

\item it is called from the interpreter, when the usser issues \verb|)edit|. In
  this case it receives exactly one argument, even if it \verb|)edit| had  no
  or several arguments supplied. 

  \begin{itemize}
  \item if several arguments were supplied, only the first is passed to
    \verb|SPADEDIT| and all the others are ignored.
  \item if no arguments were supplied, \verb|SPADEDIT| receives the last
    argument it received, or \verb|NIL| if so far \verb|)edit| was always
    called with no arguments. Furthermore, if the argument of \verb|)edit|
    starts with a dot, it is also not passed to \verb|SPADEDIT|.
  \end{itemize}

\item given the option \verb|$useFullScreenHelp| is set via
  \verb|)set help fullscreen on|, then \verb|)help| also launches
  \verb|SPADEDIT|, again with one argument, which is the
  \verb|$AXIOM/doc/spadhelp/ARG.help|, where \verb|ARG| is the argument given
  to \verb|)help|.
\end{itemize}

We want to enable user customization via a shell variable \verb|AXIOMEDITOR|.
This variable should be a string containing \verb|$name| and optionally
\verb|$line|, that gives the precise command to call the preferred editor,
makes it load \verb|$name| and go to line number \verb|$line|.  More precisely,
we will call the bash builtin \verb|eval| on that variable, after setting
\verb|line| and \verb|name| appropriately. For example, it could be something
like:
\begin{verbatim}
    emacs +$line $name 
    emacsclient +$line $name >\dev\null 2>&1
    emacsclient +$line $name 
    xemacs +$line $name 
    gnuclient +$line $name 
    { exec </dev/tty; vi +$line $name; }
    less +$line $name 
    kwrite --line $line $name 
    kate --line $line $name 
\end{verbatim}

If \verb|AXIOMEDITOR| is not set we use \verb|more| as default viewer.  Note
that this would in fact also available on \verb|MS Windows|, and even supports
the option \verb|+| there.  

There is another subtlety we have to be aware of: when \verb|axiom| is started
in the usual way, i.e., via \verb|sman|, then we do not have access to a real
terminal.  Under X, this is no problem, we simply launch an \verb|xterm|.
Otherwise, we just exit.

If \verb|axiom| is started directly via \verb|AXIOMsys|, which can be detected
using the \verb|$SPADNUM| variable, this problem does not exist.

<<*>>= 
#! /bin/sh

if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo ""
    echo "Error: SPADEDIT expects one or two arguments."
    exit
fi

DEFAULTEDITOR='more +$line $name'
DEFAULTXEDITOR='xterm -e "more +$line $name"'

if [ "$AXIOMEDITOR" = "" ] ; then
    echo ""
    if [ ! -z "$SPADNUM" ] && [ -z "$DISPLAY" ] ; then
        echo "Error: environment variable AXIOMEDITOR not set."
        echo "We are in server mode but have no X."
        echo "No default way to edit/view files."
        exit
     fi
     if [ -z "$DISPLAY" ] ; then
         echo "Warning: environment variable AXIOMEDITOR not set."
         echo "Using 'more'."
         echo "Press space to continue, 'q' to quit."
         AXIOMEDITOR=$DEFAULTEDITOR
     else
         echo "Warning: environment variable AXIOMEDITOR not set."
         echo "Launching 'more' in an 'xterm'."
         echo "Press space to continue, 'q' to quit."
         AXIOMEDITOR=$DEFAULTXEDITOR
     fi
fi

If we have only one argument, we were called by \verb|)edit| and can simply
call the text editor of our choice:

<<*>>=
if [ $# -eq 1 ]; then
    name=$1
    line=1
    eval $AXIOMEDITOR
@
%$

Otherwise, we are now in the case where we were called by HyperDoc. Since
filenames supplied by HyperDoc do not correspond to the filenames in the
current Axiom distribution as of [[patch-50]], we have to find the right file
ourselves.  We simply grep the directory containing the source files to return
file and line number within that file.  Here we assume that \verb|)abb| appears
at the beginning of a line exactly if it introduces a constructor.

<<*>>=
else
    f=$(basename $1 .spad)
    h=$(grep -n "^)abb.* $f " $AXIOM/src/algebra/*.spad.pamphlet)
    name=${h%%:*}
@

Note that we rather extract the abbreviation of the constructor, instead of
using the full name. The reason is best explained by example. Consider the
following two lines in \verb|integer.spad|:

\begin{verbatim}
)abbrev package INTSLPE IntegerSolveLinearPolynomialEquation
\end{verbatim}

and

\begin{verbatim}
)abbrev domain INT Integer
\end{verbatim}

The abreviated domain name is nicely delimited by two spaces, while we do not
know what follows the long domain name. There might be spaces and a carriage
return, maybe even comments are allowed\dots.

We assume that grep produces only one result. There is currently way in Axiom
to deal with several constructors having the same name anyway.

The next step is to obtain the name of the source file.  At some point we might
make sense to display the dvi file instead.  This would rely on
\verb|source-specials| being properly enabled, as Ralf pointed out.

We could then say, for example
\begin{verbatim}
  kdvi file:$dviname#src:$number$name.tex
\end{verbatim}
but that doesn't work yet.

Finally, we obtain the line number and call our favorite editor:

<<*>>=
    line1=${h#*:}
    line=${line1%:*}
    eval $AXIOMEDITOR
fi
@
%$
