FriCAS
======

FriCAS_ is a general purpose computer algebra system (CAS).

For installation instructions see INSTALL.
For general documentation consult https://fricas.github.io.

The basic goal of FriCAS_ is to create a free advanced world-class
CAS.  In 2007 FriCAS_ forked from Axiom_. Currently the FriCAS_ algebra
library is one of the largest and most advanced free general purpose
computer algebra systems -- this gives a good foundation to build
on.  Additionally, the FriCAS_ algebra library is written in a high
level strongly typed language (Spad), which allows natural expression
of mathematical algorithms.  This makes FriCAS_ easier to understand
and extend.

FriCAS_ uses lightweight development methodology.  Compared to Axiom_,
FriCAS_ is significantly restructured -- it is more portable and fixed
several defects. FriCAS_ removed rather large unused parts (without
removing functionality).

Current development goals:

- continue structural improvements
- add new mathematical algorithms
- develop better user interface
- develop improved Spad compiler
- make it easier for external programs to interface with FriCAS
- support for using external mathematical routines from Spad
