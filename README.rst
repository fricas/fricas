FriCAS
======

FriCAS_ is a computer algebra system (CAS). It is a fork of Axiom_.

For general documentation consult https://fricas.github.io.

The basic goal of FriCAS_ is to create a free advanced world-class
CAS. FriCAS builds on the Axiom_ codebase. Currently the FriCAS_
algebra library is the largest and most advanced free general purpose
computer algebra system -- this gives a good foundation to build on.
Additionally, the FriCAS_ algebra library is written in a high level
statically typed language (Spad), which allows natural expression of
mathematical algorithms. This makes FriCAS_ easier to understand and
extend.

FriCAS_ uses a lightweight development methodology. Compared to Axiom
FriCAS_ is significantly restructured -- it is more portable and fixed
several defects. FriCAS_ removed rather large unused parts (without
removing functionality).

Current development goals:

- continue structural improvements
- make it easier for external programs to interface with FriCAS
- develop better user interface
- support for using external mathematical routines from Spad
- developing improved Spad compiler
- add new mathematical algorithms
